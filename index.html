			<p> CHARMING 2 BEDROOM 2 BATH VILLA IN A QUIET VILLAGE DRAPANOS. 
			This comfortable 2-bedroom villa with roof terrace is situated in a quiet location and has a shared swimming pool. 
			There are 2 bathrooms, one is en-suite. The house comprises an open plan fully fitted kitchen/dining/living area, two bedrooms and two bathrooms.
			The living room has patio doors opening onto a paved terrace covered by a retractable awning. There is stone paving right round the house.
			External steps lead up to the large, tiled roof terrace, from which vantage point stunning views are afforded over serene countryside and olive groves to the majestic White Mountain range.
			The traditional village of Drapanos has a well-stocked mini-market and two tavernas with delicious Cretan cuisine within 5 minute walk from the house.
			Being only 9 minutes drive from the white, sandy beaches of Almirida, this makes the perfect holiday home for those wanting peace and quiet,
